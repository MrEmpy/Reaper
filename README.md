Reaper is a proof-of-concept designed to exploit BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) driver vulnerability. This malicious technique involves inserting a legitimate, vulnerable driver into a target system, which allows attackers to exploit the driver to perform malicious actions.

Reaper was specifically designed to exploit the vulnerability present in the kprocesshacker.sys driver in version 2.8.0.0, taking advantage of its weaknesses to gain privileged access and control over the target system.

**Note:** Reaper does not kill the Windows Defender process, as it has a protection, Reaper is a simple proof of concept.

## Features

* Kill process
